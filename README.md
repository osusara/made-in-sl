# made-in-sl
Made In Sri Lanka is an E-commerce website which sells local products in Sri Lanka. This website open up a whole new market for the local products such as Sri Lankan tea, handcrafts and other Sri Lankan products which have a massive demand in foreign countries. I'm developing this project as a mini project in my university. I'm using MERN stack to develop the project.
